                          very soon. And you probably have a couple of questions running through your mind like:
                          Do I really need that logo? Or Yep, I really need one. But how can I get it on a
                          budget? This post was created to help you bring system out of confusion so you can get
                          the best out of your business and enter the market full force. First of all, yes, you
                          do need a logo, and it does not really matter how big or small your business is. Even
                          if you making a craft soap and sell it to your relatives and friends, you still need a
                          logo. If you plan to monetize an idea, you need a logo for it. Otherwise your work,
                          your efforts, your image and your future brand belong to everyone, like grapes at a
                          grocery store. But most importantly, the final design you come up with should be
                          effective enough to promote your business and get you that place in the sun. Here are
                          a few tips that will make the whole process easier and more fun. The first step to a
                          killer logo is an idea. So start feeding your brain with new impressions and
                          experiences. Use anything that works for you. Try hiking and gain inspiration from
                          nature. Or visit an art gallery. Meditation, photography, action sports In a nutshell,
                          any kind of activity that fills you up with energy and joy may help you get that
                          revolutionary idea. It is always useful to browse the websites (or social media
                          profiles) of your potential rivals to not only judge their logos but to practice
                          analysis. Do you find your competitor logo effective or attractive? Try to think of
                          the ways it helps the rival company to be profitable. Is there something you would
                          change? Why? All of these questions can really help you to improve your own perception
                          of your brand as well as the future marketing strategy. Find out what the strengths
                          and weaknesses of your rivals are and benefit from that knowledge. When it comes to
                          logo design, there are and always will be several safe choices like bold and elegant
                          black and white logos or serif font wordmarks. But if you are striving to get that
                          killer logo, do not be afraid to cross the line and try something rebellious. Go out
                          there and get to know the latest design trends. For example, you may experiment with
                          the bold colors like Ultra Violet, which is the Pantone color of the year, by the way.
                          Or play with the typography and color gradients.</p>

                        <p>Having a solid, trusted brand is important for your company to thrive. If your target
                          audience does not know or trust your brand, how will you ever increase your customer
                          base and sales? Here are six innovative strategies you can use to increase brand
                          awareness and help your business thrive. Inviting influencers into your niche is a
                          great way to increase brand awareness and hopefully drive sales. When influencers have
                          an established audience that knows and trusts them, once they mention your product(s)
                          and discuss your brand in their content, those mentions will expand your reach and
                          increase peoples awareness of your product. Ikonick is a perfect example of a company
                          that works directly with influencers: It sells canvas art for your home and office.
                          The way Ikonick uses influencers involves providing them with art and having those
                          influencers pose with the art, then share the photos on social media. "Our
                          relationships are an important part of our business," co-founder Mark Mastrandrea told
                          me. "Our relationships make up our community, and the community is how our brand
                          grows." Ikonick uses all types of influencers, from Instagram photographers to
                          celebrities. The companys social strategy has enabled it to scale and grow
                          exponentially because its influencers become part of its sales team -- even
                          ambassadors. The relationship is mutually rewarding, Mastrandrea said. Companies can
                          also offer to sponsor influencers at an event (if they do that sort of thing) and even
                          use them as spokespersons for their brand and product(s). A lot of CrossFit-related
                          companies do this, including Rogue Fitness, which sponsors certain athletes with
                          clothing. The athlete then becomes a walking billboard for the company. Have you ever
                          received an order that came in branded packaging? Rather than see it as just another
                          shipment, perhaps you felt that that that special branding made the package seem like
                          a gift. The team knows that the product experience doesn't commence at first use, but
                          rather at the unboxing stage. How companies present their brand, and the story they
                          tell through their design and graphics, can create an emotional connection with the
                          customer that may last even longer than the product itself.</p>
